## Personal Project
**_The Personal Project_** allows students to demonstrate their ability to connect and transfer the extensive skills, knowledge and understandings they have acquired in one or more of their MYP disciplines to a global context, in order to achieve a meaningful goal of their own design. 

The project prepares students for success in the IB Diploma Programme by introducing them to the challenges of independent work, in which self-motivation is essential. The extensive research required by the project and the presentation of an academic report provide an introduction to the rigor and skills required by the DP Extended Essay.          

During the course of the personal project, students choose a learning goal and develop a product goal that connects their chose topic to their personal interest.

## Learning Goal
**_The learning_** goal I am aiming for is to become more proficient in Python. I have some experience with coding languages such as Scratch and have a basic understanding of C++, C#, and Python, being the ones that Iâ€™m most experienced with. This is why I have chosen Python as the language I will use to achieve my learning goal. To be more proficient in Python, some specific skills are essential to achieve this goal, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, and composition. These skills are used to organize your code to help you better navigate through the content that you have created.


## Product Goal
**_The product_** goal I aim to achieve during my personal project is to create a video game using Python. Python is an easy-to-learn programming language capable of various tasks, including software development, task automation, data analysis, website building, and, most importantly, game development, which is the goal I am pursuing. To view and make the game public, I will need to create an account on GitHub, which is an online forum for coders to share their projects and applications. 

A more challenging aspect of my goal is to build a website (The one that you are viewing currently) that hosts the game I am creating, inspired by the retro game "Space Invaders." This website will also showcase my coding learning journey, including my previous coding projects and portfolios.

To create criteria that measure the quality of the goal, I utilize the **S.M.A.R.T** goal format, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time. 


### **Specific**:
The goal clearly states the objective of creating a Python-based video game and a corresponding website.

### **Measurable**: 
Progress can be tracked through game development milestones, the completion of website features, and the number of coding projects showcased.

### **Achievable**: 
The goal is attainable with my existing Python skills, but it also acknowledges the need for continuous learning, specifically in areas like composition and inheritance. It adopts a learning process to acquire the necessary knowledge as I work towards the goal.

### **Relevant**: 
The goal connects with my passion for game development and coding, showing a meaningful endeavor

### **Time**: 
The goal is expected to be achieved on March 10, 2024.

## About Me
**_I started_** my coding journey when I was in the 4th grade. I used to love playing video games all the time, but some of my favorite games had critical flaws that needed fixing. That's when I became interested in learning more about coding and game development. A good game needs to be both engaging and aesthetically pleasing; however, designing and drawing are not my strongest skills. So, I decided to choose the coding path because it doesn't require any artistic talent or skill to produce its outcome. It is also an essential component in creating a game. It connects with my goal because Python is a vital programming language in the game development industry. It is nearly a requirement for creating a game due to the versatility of the language; it can be used to develop games for various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web. Things that I could do outside of school are things such as work on coding projects independently and learn more in-depth about programming languages, like Python.
